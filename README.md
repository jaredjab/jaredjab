- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jaredjab
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in natural science, esports, video games, art, automation, and problem solving.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently building on my data analytics skills (Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Azure, and most importantly: Identifying problems and creating impactful solutions to address them)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredjab/)!

As a Data Analyst at Nashville Software School, I learned and applied data analytics fundamentals and problem-solving skills to real-world datasets and projects. With the help of expert instructors and mentors, I have gained proficiency in various tools and techniques, such as SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, APIs, webscraping, geospatial analysis, and PostgreSQL. I have also presented my findings and recommendations to stakeholders from the community, demonstrating effective communication and collaboration skills.

Before joining the bootcamp, I was a server at M Street Entertainment Group, where I excelled in creating high-end customer experiences, operating POS, and multitasking in a high-stress environment. I also have a partial bachelor's degree in computer science - software engineering from Southern New Hampshire University, and a background in graphic design, which gives me a unique perspective and a strong foundation in logic, creativity, and design principles. I am passionate about automation, astronomy, nature, esports, art, and always learning new things. I am actively seeking career opportunities that will support my growth as a problem solver and collaborator, and that will allow me to leverage my data analytics skills to make a positive impact.
