HELLO, I'm Jared. Jab for usernames.

**How to reach me**: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredjab/)!

As a **Data Analyst** at Nashville Software School, I learned and applied data analytics fundamentals and problem-solving skills to real-world datasets and projects. With the help of expert instructors and mentors, I have gained proficiency in various tools and techniques, such as **SQL**, **Python**, **Tableau**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, **APIs**, **webscraping**, **geospatial analysis**, and **project management**. I have presented my findings and recommendations to stakeholders from the community, demonstrating effective communication and collaboration skills.

I also have a partial bachelor's degree in **computer science**, and a background in **graphic design**, and a lifetime of learning tools and solving puzzles. I have a unique perspective and a strong foundation in **logic**, **troubleshooting**, and **design principles**. I am passionate about automation, astronomy, nature, esports, art, and always learning new things. **I am actively seeking career opportunities that will support my growth as a data and software professional**, and that will allow me to leverage my data analytics skills to make a positive impact with actionable insights.

In my time at SNHU, I also learned Object-Oriented Programming, Agile Methodologies, Product Design Documentation, and more foundational concepts. At SNHU I used Python, Java, and C++. While my focus is data analytics, I am also interested in pursuing **full stack software development** and **data engineering**.

- 👀 I’m interested in natural science, esports, video games, art, automation, and problem solving.
- 🌱 I’m currently building on my data analytics skills (Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Azure, Snowflake, and most importantly: Identifying problems and creating impactful solutions to address them)

- ⚡ Fun facts:
  - All the pokemon would beat 1 billion lions.
  - There has GOT to be more wheels than doors.
