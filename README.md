Hello, I'm Jared! Jab for usernames.

**How to reach me**: Connect with & message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredjab/)!

As a **Data Analyst** at Nashville Software School, I learned and applied data analytics fundamentals and problem-solving skills to real-world datasets and projects. With the help of expert instructors and mentors, I have gained proficiency in various tools and techniques, such as **SQL**, **Python**, **Tableau**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, **APIs**, **webscraping**, **geospatial analysis**, and **project management**. I have presented my findings and recommendations to stakeholders from the community, demonstrating effective communication and collaboration skills.

I also have a partial bachelor's degree in **computer science**, and a background in **graphic design**, and a lifetime of learning tools and solving puzzles. I have a unique perspective and a strong foundation in **logic**, **troubleshooting**, and **design principles**. I am passionate about automation, astronomy, nature, esports, art, and having new experiences. **I am actively seeking career opportunities that will support my growth as a data and software professional**, and that will allow me to leverage my data analytics skills to make a positive impact with actionable insights.

In my time at SNHU, I also learned Object-Oriented Programming, Agile Methodologies, Product Design Documentation, and more foundational concepts. At SNHU I used Python, Java, and C++. While my focus is data analytics, I am also very interested in pursuing **full stack software development** and **data engineering**.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in natural science, esports, video games, art, yoga, automation, F1, and food.
